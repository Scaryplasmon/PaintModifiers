# PaintModifiers
Blender Addon
Hello there, 

this is Paint Modifiers a little addon I've created for Blender. 

It allows you to have a one-click button solution to start painting the vertex group of your modifiers. 

For now, it Supports Decimate, Displace, Solidify and Smooth modifiers.

The Shortcut to access the Menu it's Alt+V

Here's an Overview https://youtu.be/wZseNDTaebY

Cool thing about this workflow it's that it's totally non-Destructive (you can delete and alter the Modifiers at any time)

You can Keep stacking up your Modifiers and alter them later.

Hope it Helps, happy Bl :)
